# Mental Health Chatbot

A machine learning and NLP-based project designed to analyze mental health-related data and provide insightful conversational support. This chatbot uses advanced natural language processing techniques to assist users by understanding their inputs and offering appropriate responses or mental health insights.




## Introduction

The Mental Health Chatbot is developed to assist users by providing mental health-related support through conversational interaction. By leveraging text data, the chatbot can identify key mental health concerns and deliver empathetic and supportive responses.

The primary objective is to help users recognize patterns in mental health discussions and offer relevant advice or actions based on natural language inputs. The chatbot is powered by machine learning models and pre-trained word embeddings.
## Features

--> Sentiment analysis for emotional tone detection.

--> Semantic understanding using pre-trained word embeddings (Gensim).

--> Predictive modeling for identifying mental health concerns.

--> Topic modeling and keyword extraction for insightful suggestions.

--> Low latency response generation for real-time interaction.
## Technologies Used

--> Python

--> Pandas for data manipulation

--> Gensim for word embeddings and semantic similarity

--> NLTK and SpaCy for natural language processing

--> Scikit-learn for machine learning models
## Usage

1. Load the dataset (mentalhealth.csv).
2. Preprocess the text data using the included scripts.
3. Train the chatbot using the models provided, or load pre-trained models.
4. Interact with the chatbot by entering text inputs related to mental health concerns.
5. The chatbot will analyze the input and provide feedback or predictions based on the trained models.
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is mentalhealth.csv, which contains user-generated data related to mental health discussions, symptoms, and emotions. Make sure to follow any licensing or usage guidelines associated with the dataset.
